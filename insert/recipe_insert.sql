Add another 1 tsp oil and cook the onion and carrots for 1-2 mins until slightly softened, then push the veg and bacon to one side of the pan. Add the final 1 tsp oil, then pour in the egg, stirring constantly to scramble it.

Add the green beans and peas, and cook, stirring, for 1-2 mins until hot through. Divide between two plates and serve with sweet chilli sauce for drizzling. Break the prawn crackers into rough crumbs. The crackers absorb moisture quickly so, to keep them crunchy, it’s best to serve them in a dish on the side to sprinkle over the rice while eating.', 2);
